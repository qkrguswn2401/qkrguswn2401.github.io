Motivation: when vocabulray is large, models become too complex to be solved unlike the HMM with small vocabulary size.  Simple HMM model with small vocab can be decoded with Viterbi decoding.

WFST is compoesed of  multiple transducers to a signle transducer and uses it to search for a grammtically-sound sentence.
It provides a natural representation for HMM phonetic models, context-dependent phones, pronunciation lexicons, and grammars.

Weights are associated with edges as costs or probability.
WFST composes transducers together to build structures.  Transducer encode a mapping between the input and the output label sequences.  
From the table blewo, HMM trasducers convert HMM states into context-depedent phones.
